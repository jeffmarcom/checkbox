CloudBox
========

CloudBox is a testing tool for OpenStack and other cloud solutions

Installation
============

Installation is a bit tricky. You need to have python3-plainbox installed first
(which may come from the checkbox daily ppa) or you need to (recommended, for
the time being) develop plainbox.
